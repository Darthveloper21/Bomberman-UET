This could be the last version. (not any more ^^)

## About game
This is a two players game, the mission of each player is to defeat the other one by the one and only weapon in the game: bomb

The player movement could be hard to control but this is the best i can do :(((

You can get the wooden box exploded but not the stone-cell.
If the wooden box is exploded, there is a chance that it contains a power pill waiting for you to absord.
There are only two kinds of power pill, fire to increase the length of your bomb's explosion, sonic to enhence your speed.

If a player is in the explosion arena, he/she loses.

Sound effect works a bit ... bad.

You can press the esc key at any time to exit the game.

Copy all .dll files to the same folder with .cbp and source code files.

Rar file contains exe file, it runs the game without source code.

### Hope you enjoy my project <3
I do trying to add bomb-pocket-power pill (player can set more than just one bomb at the same time), but a lot of issues appear and my coding skills have limitation :(((.
It gonna requires a lot of change in my code which is working very fine at the moment :(((
I will try to add this feature to the game but i can't promise so ... this could be the last version as i mentioned.
