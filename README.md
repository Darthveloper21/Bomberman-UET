# Bomberman-UET
Another game coded by 19021268 :3

## Version
This could be the last version.

## About game
This a two players game, the mission of each player is to defeat the other one by the one and only weapon in the game: bomb

The player movement could be hard to control but this is the best i can do :(((

You can get the wooden box exploded but not the stone-cell.
If the wooden box is exploded, there is a chance that it contains a power pill waiting for you to absord.
There are only two kinds of power pill, fire to increase the length of your bomb's explosion, sonic to enhence your speed.

If a player is in the explosion arena, he/she loses.

You can press the esc key at any time to exit the game.

### Hope you enjoy my project <3
I do trying to add bomb-pocket-power pill (player can set more than just one bomb at the same time), but a lot of issues appear and my coding kills have limitation :(((.
It gonna requires a lot of change in my code which is working very fine at the moment :(((
I will try to add this feature to the game but i can't promise so ... this could be the last version as i mentioned.
